## Practice Time
Create a program that suggests an activity based on various parameters.

Start in a new file with a main function.
From main(), create a function, whatShouldIDoToday().

Let the function have three parameters.
mood: a required string parameter
weather: a string parameter that defaults to "sunny"
temperature: an Integer parameter that defaults to 24 (Celsius).

Use a when construct to return some activities based on combinations of conditions. For example:
mood == "happy" && weather == "Sunny" -> "go for a walk"
else -> "Stay home and read."

Copy/paste your finished function into REPL, and call it with combinations of arguments. For example:
whatShouldIDoToday("sad")
> Stay home and read.

#### Note: Keep your work as you will do more with this code in the next practice.
